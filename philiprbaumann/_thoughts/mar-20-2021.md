name: My first seed

This is, hopefully, the first seed I will plant in this "digital garden" of my life. I have become especially disappointed with social media and the data collection that ocurrs behind the scenes. Even more so, I find it often times makes a person think about what they don't have instead of being thankful for what they do have.

So now I'm here. On my own webpage, making my own garden of digital content that I hope to share with anyone who cares enough to check this page.
