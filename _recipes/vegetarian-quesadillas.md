title:  Vegetarian Quesadillas
---

My sister found this recipe on Pinterest and I'm a huge fan. It's pretty comparable to a normal quesadilla, except its made with sweet potatoes that adds a nice sweetness to a general spicy and savory dish.

Ingredients - Makes 4/6 Quesadillas
 - 1 large sweet potato
 - 1 red onion
 - fresh cilantro
 - chili powder
 - salt
 - cumin
 - onion powder
 - 1 can of black beans
 - frozen corn or corn salsa
 - cheese
 - flour (I prefer whole wheat) tortillas
 - I also like some sour cream for topping.

Here are the steps to make them:

1. Preheat the oven to 375.
2. Dice the sweet potato into small one inch to half an inch pieces.
3. Toss the sweet potatoes in your seasonings and olive oil.
4. Put the sweet potatos in a glass dish or on a metal baking sheet and place them in the oven.
5. Bake those bad boys for about thirty minutes or until they are soft to the touch. Leave that oven on when you take them out.
6. Once these sweet potatos are complete, add them to a bowl with your black beans and corn.
7. Season to taste and prepare to form your quesadillas. Add diced red onion to the mix.
8. Layout the bottoms of your quesadillas.
9. Scoop the potato, black bean, and corn mix onto the base tortilla. Add some cheese so that the tortilla sticks on both sides.
10. Place a tortilla on top and lightly brush on some olive oil.
11. Take them all and thrown them in the oven! I cook them for 15-18 minutes on 375.
12. Serve with a side of salsa or sour cream and enjoy!
