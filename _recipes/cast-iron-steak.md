title:  Cast Iron Steak
---

I woke up this past weekend with one thought on my mind: a fresh steak. After researching for a few too many hours, I walked to a nearby convenience store and purchased a cast iron steak. Here's the best recipe I found. Sort of a modified version of Alton Brown's approach. This is gonna create a decent amount of smoke so I'd recommend opening a few windows and maybe disabling some fire alarms. Also, if the oil catches on fire, remove oxygen from the oil... **do not pour water onto an oil fire.**

With that being said! Here's what we need:

Ingredients -
- One ribeye or skirt steak (1 inch to 1.5 inch cut)
- Safflower oil (or some other high smoke point oil)

Here are the steps to make them:

1. Preheat the oven to 500 and place the cast iron skillet in the oven.
2. While this is preheating, bring the steak to room temperature.
3. Coat the steak with a generous pinch of salt on every side. Move the steak around the plate to soak up anymore seasoning. 
4. Coat the steak lightly in the Safflower.
5. Take the cast iron skillet out of the oven carefully.
6. Place the steak on the skillet for one minute without moving. 
7. Flip the steak over and put it back in the oven. 
8. Leave the steak in the oven for 5 minutes.
9. Take the steak back out and flip it, place it back in the oven for 4 minutes. 
10. Take the steak out of the oven and let it rest for 2-4 minutes. I like to place butter and garlic on top of the steak before wrapping it in tin foil. 


This will cook to about medium - medium rare if done properly. Feel free to add a minute or so to the oven time if you'd like the steak to be more well done.
