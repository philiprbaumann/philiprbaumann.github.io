title:  Miner's Pie
---
I got this great Dungeons and Dragons recipe book from a family member and went about making one of the recip.es This is the "Miner's Pie". According to lore, it's Dwarvish. 


Ingredients -
- 2lb Ground Beef
- Olive Oil
- Bag of frozen corn
- Bag of frozen pees 
- Parsely
- Onion
- Leak (can swap with more onion)
- Tomato paste
- Flour
- 3lb Potatoes
- Chicken bouillon
- Thyme 
- Ale (heavier the better, oatmeal stout recommended).
- Bay leaf
- Parmesan cheese
- Eggs


Here is my modified recipe:

 1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
 2. Add onion, leek, bay leaf, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened (about 4 minutes).
 3. Stir in ground beef and cook, stirring frequently, for approximately 10 minutes.
 4. Add garlic, thyme, and tomato paste, and cook for about 1 minute.
 5. Reduce heat to medium, add flour, and stir until fully combined (about 2 minutes).
 6. Pour in ale, broth, and 2/3 teaspoon of salt. Increase heat to high and bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the skillet to dissolve any browned bits (about 1 minute).
 7. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the filling thickens but remains saucy (about 15 minutes).
 8. Add corn and peas, then set aside the skillet to cool slightly. Remove bay leaf, add most of the parsley, and stir.
 9. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.
 10. Transfer the mixture into a broiler-safe 2-quart casserole dish, spreading it evenly.
 11. Set aside the mixture to cool for about 20 minutes.
 12. Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit with the rack in the upper-middle position.
 13. Place potatoes into a pot of boiling water until very tender (about 20 minutes).
 14. Mash the potatos when properly boiled and add melted butter. Stir to combine.
 15. Mix in milk, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese. Stir well and adjust seasoning to taste.
 16. Add eggs to the potatoes and stir until fully incorporated.
 17. Spoon the potato mixture over the filling in the casserole dish, spreading it evenly.
 18. Bake until the filling is heated through and the potatoes are slightly puffed (about 20 minutes).
 19. Sprinkle with remaining parsley before serving hot.
 20. Turn on the broiler and broil until the top is golden brown (5-7 minutes).
