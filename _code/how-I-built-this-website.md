title:  How I Built This Website
---

After coming across digital gardens online, I decided I wanted to build one myself. I began this process by researching personal websites and digital gardens that I found interesting, dynamic, or unique. A ton of my inspiration goes out to these developers, so thank you!

Here's a small sample of these pages:
- [https://tomcritchlow.com/](https://tomcritchlow.com/)(This was the very first digital garden that I found which pretty much made me instantly think "I want to build something like this.")
- [https://rsms.me/](https://rsms.me/)(This is just an absolutely beautiful page made by a CSS guru who I personally look up to when it comes to web development.)
- [https://busterbenson.com/piles/](https://busterbenson.com/piles/)(An alternative take on the digital garden that I discovered through Maggie Appleton's article below.)

So, I come across this concept of a digital garden. Mind you, I'm not actively developing a website at this point. But this idea wasn't something that appeared and disappeared in passing. It burrowed into my brain.

A great quote from Maggie Appleton's fantastic [article](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):

>The point of the garden is that's it's a personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that are particular to you.

This is more about making something *all by myself* containing *whatever I want* in *whatever format I want*. The beauty here is the dynamic nature (see what I did there) of the garden and the fact that it isn't a continuos feed of curated content, but rather an ever-changing, and very raw, work in progress. The goal here isn't pristine styling and perfect content; it's about growth, over time, above all else.


After perusing numerous digital gardens and working up the courage to begin my own, I struck out with a clear design in mind.

1. Let's host on Github pages, because who wants to pay money to run a server.
2. Let's buy a domain name, because who wants Github in their domain name (sorry, not sorry Github).
3. Let's use Jekyll. A clear favorite of digital gardeners (is that a term? I'm not sure), Jekyll allows developers to exist between the worlds of templated Bootstrap and static blogs like Wordpress. It's the perfect technology for a digital garden and has been a joy to learn.
4. Let's use SCSS, because organizing CSS let's me think better.
5. Let's have some fun and figure out the rest along the way.
