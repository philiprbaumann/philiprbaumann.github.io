Spring time in New York City is something else. Daylight savings shifts, the heavy cloak of winter lifts, and the city revives. Suddenly a walk after work is something you look forward to and the park echoes with the laughter of entwined lovers. 

I'm not a big runner, but I went on two 3.5 mile runs this week and it felt like the easiest exercise I've done in the last five years. When I ran in the past, it was a race against myself fueled by upbeat music and frustration. These two runs were like coming out of hibernation; fueled by sunlight and fresh breezes. 

I can't wait to see how this spring and summer will go.
