It's funny. A lot of my friends seem to detest turning twenty four. Some seem to view it as the end of the early 20s, the entrance into your mid-20s, and a new avalanche of responsibilities or considerations. To me, nothing seems to change. In fact, for some reason, I still feel young. Far more mature than a student, but stable enough to pursue my own hobbies and invest in myself. Something I feel I never had the time to do during school. Regardless, here's to 24; a year of growth, family, and vaccinations.
