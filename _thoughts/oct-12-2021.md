I've officially reached the end of a long and arduous journey to spinning up my technical interview skills. A goal I set out to achieve four months ago. Some statistics on the matter:

- 169 code challenge problems
- 57 easy problems
- 100 medium problems
- 12 hard problems
- 116 emails 
- 2 technical projects
- 16 interviews
- 4 final rounds 
- 12 system design practices sessions 
- 2 entire notebooks filled with notes
- 3 pens
- 71 trips to gym
- 1 dream job 

Looking forward to starting this new journey.
