I lucked out this year as Jesus Christ's resurrection and my birthday occur on the same day. Generally, Easter dates repeat every eleven years, but funnily enough the last time this occured was in 2003. I'd have been six. It's crazy to think that this was nearly two decades ago. A quarter of my life has passed and sometimes I still feel like the same dumb kid. The only difference is that now I pay taxes. All shitty jokes aside, turning a quarter century brings with it a lot of love from the friends and family who continue to support me and the life I live. I cannot imagine becoming the man I am today without the support of so many individuals. Life is good, looking forward to seeing what this next year holds.
