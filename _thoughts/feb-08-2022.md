I got a cat! She's a rescue from my hometown and a gentle little lovebug. I have no idea why it took me this long to post about her. She's a goofy lil cutie who quickly purs when picked up. She'll gladly spend an hour slumped on your chest. A big fan of lasers, she loves scratching posts and absolutely detests a comfy fur bed.
