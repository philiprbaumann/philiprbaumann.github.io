This is the first seed I will plant in this "digital garden" of my life. After getting some inspiration from Tom Critchlow's [website](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) I decided to start creating my own digital garden.


So now I'm here. On my own webpage. Making my own garden of digital content that I hope to share with anyone who is interested.
