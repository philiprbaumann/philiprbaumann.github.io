Today is the first "Two's Day" of this year. If I understand it correctly, there will only be two of these left. Next time we'll have this is in eleven years from now. I wonder what I'll be like in eleven years. I wonder if this website will still be around or if it'll be anything more significant. Maybe my digital garden would have grown some new limbs. Who knows. All I know is that its "Two's Day" and we may as well enjoy it.
