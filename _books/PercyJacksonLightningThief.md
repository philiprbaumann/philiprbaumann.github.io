Just completed re-reading this entire series. I've always felt an appreciation for Greek mythology and this series manages to translate it into a digestible form. The concept of prophecies and the Oracle of Delphi also spices up each book. No complaints, but definitely isn't anything groundbreaking. Finishing these actually made me feel like I need to start reading something with vocabulary above a third grade level; not sure if that's a positive or a negative.
