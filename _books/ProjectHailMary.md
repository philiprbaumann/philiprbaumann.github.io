After a day at the museum with my significant other, I had the chance to swing by a bookshop on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. I browsed through a few different books before this one caught my eye. I read *The Martian* a few years ago and loved it. A few years later, my sister met Andy Weir in person and got me a signed copy of *Artemis*. I've even posted *The Egg* on this website. All in all, I think Andy Weir is one of my favorite authors. This book is no exception. It's not exactly introspective or compelling literature, but rather a novel which forces you to work your brain muscles. Moving between fundamental physics theories, to geometry, to quantum particles, this book takes you on a trip. What Andy Weir truly excels at is his ability to write scientifically believable and intriguing fiction. A depiction of space exploration and extraterrestrial life that feels believable and an absolute joy to read. I'd highly recommend this one, but may not be for everyone.
