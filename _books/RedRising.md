My brother recommended this book as a throwaway science fiction fantasy book I'd like. I didn't expect it to become one of my favorite series of all time. The first book is a combination of *Ender's Game*, *Hunger Games*, and *Percy Jackson*. It's honestly a little stunted, but still a fun read. Where this series truly excels is in the next two books. It keeps up it's somewhat kitchy action, but blows the world up into something truly enjoyable. *Game of Thrones*-esque intrigue amongst various factions drives the plot. Even more, side characters have complex motivations and you rarely can predict what comes next. The first book is by far the worst one and it only gets better from there.

I'd highly recommend Pierce Brown to anyone with an appreciation for fiction and genuinely solid characters and dialogue. It's actually become a little difficult pivoting to other series after this just because I enjoyed it so much.
