Nothing quite like an Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher masterpiece. The dialogue is on point and the movement between court room and Zuckerberg's past is seamless. The cast is also top tier. I will say, the film does seem to lose pace about sixty percent of the way through. Still, would highly recommend this to anyone with an appreciation for well written dialogue and a window into the mind of one of the most powerful people in the world today.
