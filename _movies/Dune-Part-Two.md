There's not much to say about "Dune" other than that it's the type of movie that feels like an investment for the second installment. The good news? This movie makes it all worthwhile. 

Truly epic.

Reminds me of the *Red Rising* series which probably makes me a little biased. The ending felt very reminiscent of the epic handoffs of power often times found in Pierce Brown's books.
