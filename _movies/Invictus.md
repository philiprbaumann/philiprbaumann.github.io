There's something about biographical dramas that make me feel like I'm learning and relaxing at the same time. Even more, there's something about sports dramas that motivate me like none other. Nelon Mandela's unification of a nation through rugby is undeniable and inspirational. To go from imprisonment to dismantling apartheid in South Africa makes me speechless. 

Also, Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon in the same movie? Second to none.
