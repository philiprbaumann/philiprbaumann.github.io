Felt like they were creating 3D renders that they could resell to video game publishers and museums. I don't understand why the same conflict was replayed over and over again. Blue kids see fake blue humans, blue kids tell blue parents, fake blue humans capture kids, blue parents come and kill fake blue humans, kids escape. I'm not kidding when I say I think this situation repeated five times. I actually got so bored I zoned out for significant portions of the fights. 

The crazy thing is that there was no resolution to any of these conflicts at the end.

Sorta cool visuals; trash movie.
