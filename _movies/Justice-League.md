Why does this movie have a dark tint on every shot? Why did they cast nearly a dozen actors who have no emotions? Why is it presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio? Why does Ben Affleck feel like a frumpy Batman?

Maybe a darker take on the superhero trend; maybe just a boring movie. I wish I could have these four hours back. 

The Flash's quick remarks makes this trite film at least somewhat digestible.
