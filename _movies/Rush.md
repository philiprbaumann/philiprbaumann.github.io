A lot better than I expected. There's something about historical fiction that I really adore; maybe its the concept of learning and relaxing at the same time. One quote really stuck with me though: "A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends". Nothing quite like a 17th century Spanish proverb to wrap up a movie. Thanks Baltasar Graci√°n.
