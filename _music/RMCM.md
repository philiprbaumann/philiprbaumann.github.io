I discovered *Richy Mitch & The Coal Miners* at a particularly pivotal moment in my life. Overcoming a serious sickness with unbearable kidney stones, I felt life eroding the sense of pride I'd built over the last four years of college. They are raw, simplistic, and heartfelt. Nothing fancy, just a couple people recording music in a barebones studio. I consider them to be a huge inspiration musically and a band I'd hope to one day mirror.
